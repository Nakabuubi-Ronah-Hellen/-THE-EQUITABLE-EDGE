<H1>GENDER EQUALITY</H1>
<H2>IT HAS TO BE FAIR AND JUST FOR ALL US.</H2>
   <p>
      This project focuses on promoting gender equality by creating awareness and providing
      equal opporturnities for all genders,in employment sectors,leadership, and education.
      It aims to reduce discrimination,challege stereotypes, and empower both men and women
      to participate fully in society.   
   </p> 
   <p>
      Our society has to have the equalness as one , not to look at a man as the only source
     of knowledge and power. Women should also be gaven a platform to rise a point and be 
     seen as capable people in the society.
     I won't say all but in some areas of Uganda eg Karamoja women are not of vaule at all , the only 
     thing they do is stay home and take good care of the kids and home.
